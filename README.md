# Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytical Project** repository!
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing solution. Designed as a portfolio project that highlights industry best practices in data engineering. I make this portfolio based on Youtube channel **Data With Baraa** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSKVgrwhzus&t=87335s.

## Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
1. **Data Architecure**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transfroming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modelling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

## Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV Files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data wuality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business and analytics team.
